<h2 class="h5 mt-4">Preamble</h2>
<p>
  NAVCA was established in response to the vulnerability experienced by communities in South Sudan following years of conflict
  and limited access to basic services. NAVCA prioritizes vulnerable populations—especially women and children—recognizing
  systemic barriers that have historically limited women’s access to ownership, opportunity, and justice.

<p>
  To foster a safe, peaceful, and inclusive society that upholds human dignity, protects the environment and wildlife,
  promotes access to basic socio-economic services, and advances good governance, the rule of law, gender equality, and human rights.
</p>

<h2 class="h5 mt-4">Mission</h2>
<p>
  NAVCA shall endeavour to improve the quality of living of the most vulnerable communities and groups in South Sudan
  with emphasis to women, children, the elderly, and people living with disability.
